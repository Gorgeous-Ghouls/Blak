### An uncompromising chat client made in python

A chat client that has many features that help the user in getting an experience they never had before.

We are  Gorgeous-Ghouls and for as long as chat clients have existed we have tried to use chat client made by human devs.  
but we have found those to be lacking in features we as ghouls need.

So we took it into our hands, making a chat client that can fulfill our needs.

Blak as all the features that a traditional chat client has but also has additional features that we think a chat client should have.  
Prior to this we selected a few humans to test the app, but they failed to see the features we added to the app, they kept saying that there is a **bug in the app**, no **it's not a bug it's a feature**


#### Conversations like this took place

```
YandereDev: Hey!!, I just got to test you app, and
            I think there is a bug in the app


Ken Kaneki: That is very unfortunate to hear,
            can u tell me about the bug

YandereDev: yes, so I just launched the app and was looking at the UI
            out of nowhere the colors on the screen changed, so I tried
            looking around in the app, and the colors fixed themselves.
            this seems to be happening when every I leave the app idle for
            some time. pls fix

Ken Kaneki: The color changing when app is left idle is not a bug,
            its a feature to check if you are still using the app,
            and keep you focus on the app 😎
```
as you can clearly see that these humans are not able to comprehend the greatness of our app

We ask you to test the app yourself and broaden the horizons of these mortals

🙏🙏🙏
